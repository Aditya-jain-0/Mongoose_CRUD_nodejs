# Mongoose_CRUD_nodejs

This repository demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.

To use the Mongoose CRUD operations repository, you will need to fulfill the following requirements:

Node.js and npm: Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org

MongoDB: Install and set up MongoDB on your machine. You can download MongoDB Community Server from the official website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

You have two options to interact with the MongoDB database:

a. MongoDB Shell: Install the MongoDB Shell, which provides a command-line interface for interacting with MongoDB. You can download the shell from the official MongoDB website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

b. MongoDB Compass: Alternatively, you can install MongoDB Compass, a GUI tool for visually exploring and interacting with MongoDB databases. MongoDB Compass can be downloaded from the official MongoDB website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass
